                        <p>In September of 2019, a diverse group of individuals descended upon the YWEB Career Academy serendipitously, unaware of the significance it would have on their lives. A rare opportunity to aspire to great heights, broaden horizons presented itself by studying front end web development at the YWCA.  The group aptly named and known as Cohort 11,  discovered their potential and passion for web development. Realizing they are more than just students taking a course, but a dedicated team committed to helping one another achieve success. Cohort 11 united in victories and struggles to form a cohesive bond. Giving birth to the idea to develop their first live website in hopes to share and expand knowledge, acquire experience and have a positive impact on the community in which they live.</p>
